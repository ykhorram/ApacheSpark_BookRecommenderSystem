# Apache Spark and Book Recommendation

Recommender Systems are a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" that a user would give to an item. The netflix prize is one of the most well-known challenges, that fuelled research and development of new algorithms in these area.

In this repository, I'm implementing two of the main approaches to build recommender systems, namely the Memory based and model based collaborative filterings. I also take this opportunity to explore the Apache Spark MLLib library which implements various Machine Learning algorithms.

A) Memory based collaborative filtering
1. Item-based
2. User-based 

B) Model-based collaborative filtering using matrix factorization
1. SVD dimensionality reduction
2. Alternating Least Square ( implemented in Spark)
